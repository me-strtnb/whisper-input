# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to open-wispr.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo and clone it
2. Run the dev script:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/dev.sh
   ```

The dev script handles everything you need to build and run from source:

1. **Configure** — prompts you to pick a Whisper model size (tiny through medium, English-only or multilingual), language, spoken punctuation, and hotkey. Press enter on any prompt to keep the current value from `~/.config/open-wispr/config.json`.
2. **Clean up** — stops any running open-wispr instances and removes the Homebrew-installed version (if present) so it doesn't conflict with your local build. Installs `whisper-cpp` via Homebrew if needed.
3. **Build** — runs `swift build -c release` from source.
4. **Bundle** — packages the binary into a macOS app bundle (`OpenWispr.app`) and copies it to `~/Applications/` so macOS properly recognizes it for accessibility and microphone permissions.
5. **Start** — launches the app directly so you can test immediately.

## What to work on

Check the [open issues](https://github.com/human37/open-wispr/issues) for bugs and feature requests. If you want to work on something not listed, open an issue first to discuss it.

## Guidelines

- Keep it simple. open-wispr is intentionally minimal.
- No cloud dependencies. Everything must run on-device.
- Test on Apple Silicon. Intel Macs are not supported.
- Match the existing code style.
